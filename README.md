## Serverless Components

1. **Transcript Processing Service**: Use Google Cloud Functions with Python and FastAPI. Trigger the function upon receiving raw text transcripts.

2. **GPT-4 Interaction Service**: Similar to the Transcript Processing Service, use Google Cloud Functions. Trigger this function after the transcript has been processed.

3. **Database Interaction Service**: Use Neo4j AuraDB as your managed database. You can interact with it directly from your serverless functions using Neo4j's Python driver.

4. **Authentication and Security Service**: Auth0 can be integrated directly into your serverless functions for authentication.

5. **Tooling and Infrastructure**: 
    - **Containerization**: Not needed for serverless components.
    - **Orchestration**: Managed by GCP.
    - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions can deploy directly to Google Cloud Functions.
    - **Monitoring**: Use Google Cloud Monitoring.
    - **Caching**: Use Google Cloud Memorystore (compatible with Redis).
    - **Load Balancing**: Managed by GCP for serverless components.

### Terraform Structure

1. **Backend Services**: Separate Terraform modules for each serverless function and other services.
2. **Tooling and Infrastructure**: Terraform modules for GitHub Actions setup, Monitoring, and Memorystore.
3. **Variables and Outputs**: Use Terraform variables for configurable settings and outputs for service endpoints.

## Directory Structure

```plaintext

├── main.tf
├── variables.tf

└── modules
    ├── transcript_processing
    ├── gpt4_interaction
    ├── database_interaction

## Sample Terraform Code for a Serverless Function

```hcl
module "transcript_processing" {
  source = "./modules/transcript_processing"
  name   = "transcript-processing-function"
  runtime = "python310"
  entry_point = "process_transcript"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform for all cloud resources.
2. **State Management**: Use Google Cloud Storage as a backend for Terraform state.
3. **Modularization**: Keep Terraform code modular for each service.
4. **Continuous Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate Google Cloud Monitoring for real-time metrics.

By using Neo4j AuraDB, you can maintain the serverless architecture while leveraging a powerful graph database.
