# NAI Authentication and Security Service

### 1. **Define JWT Structure**
   - **Header**: Use HMAC with SHA-256 (HS256) or RSA with SHA-256 (RS256) for signing.
   - **Payload**: Include user type, client ID, permissions, and expiration time.
   - **Signature**: Sign with a strong and securely stored secret key.

### 2. **Implement User Model**
   - **Database Schema**: Define fields for email, password hash, user type, client ID.
   - **Haskell Data Types**: Create corresponding Haskell data types.

### 3. **Develop Authentication Endpoints**
   - **Login Endpoint**: For user authentication.
   - **Logout Endpoint**: To invalidate tokens (optional).
   - **Token Refresh Endpoint**: For token renewal.

### 4. **Implement Authorization Middleware**
   - **Token Validation**: Verify signature and expiration.
   - **Permission Checking**: Validate user type and permissions.

### 5. **Implement Token Security**
   - **Signing Key**: Use a strong key and store it securely.
   - **Expiration**: Set appropriate token expiration and implement refresh tokens.
   - **HTTPS**: Ensure secure transmission using HTTPS.

### 6. **Implement Password Security**
   - **Hashing**: Use bcrypt with a strong salt for password hashing.
   - **Storage**: Store hashed passwords securely in the database.

### 7. **Integration with Other Services**
   - **Authentication**: Validate Service Users and API Users as needed.

### 8. **Testing**
   - **Unit Tests**: For individual components.
   - **Integration Tests**: For the entire authentication flow.

### 9. **API Documentation**
   - **Provider**: Use Swagger or Postman for interactive API documentation.
   - **Content**: Include endpoints, request/response formats, error handling.

### 10. **Containerization**
   - **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile to define the container for the service.
   - **Images**: Build Docker images for different environments (development, production).

### 11. **Orchestration**
   - **Kubernetes**: Define Kubernetes manifests for deployment, scaling, and management.
   - **Services**: Set up Kubernetes services for internal and external communication.

### 12. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring using tools like Prometheus.
   - **Logging**: Set up logging to track authentication activities and potential security issues.

### 13. **Compliance and Security Auditing**
   - **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.
   - **Auditing**: Regularly review and update security measures.

### Conclusion
This comprehensive plan outlines the steps to build the Centralized Authentication and Security Service, focusing on best practices for JWT, password security, containerization, orchestration, and API documentation. By following this plan, you'll create a robust, scalable, and secure authentication service that lays the foundation for the rest of the system. Each step provides the necessary detail to guide the development process, ensuring a successful implementation.
